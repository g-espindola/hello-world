        <p class="text">Today has been a great day so far! There’s still a lot to happen today but I think I’m almost done coding for the day. Today I completed more exercises on FreeCodeCamp and added a few extra things to my blog. The idea is to improve the blog as I get better. The design that I have now is very, very simple, but I like it a lot so I think I will leave the blog like this until I can make some actual improvements to it. I also have the goal to code everyday and to make GitHubs contributions daily, I just like the green activity graph so much and I can sure use the experience. Win win!</p>

        <p class="text">Welcome to my blog! This is my first entry of, hopefully, many. In here I will try to share with everyone what I’m learning and how I’m progressing on my way to become a full-stack web developer. I’ll also be sharing my progress in college to become a computer scientist. There’s still a lot for me to learn and do. The world of technology still looks very intimidating to me at times but I’m sure I’ll be alright. A little about my coding background: I have some experience with JavaScript that I got from an online course. Currently, I’m learning more about HTML and CSS on FreeCodeCamp, but nothing too fancy yet, and I also understand a little bit of Java that I got from my computer science course. My progress today was that I did a few CSS exercises on FreeCodeCamp and also finished uploading my learning exercises to GitHub to get familiarized with the workflow. I think I’ll be uploading all of my projects and exercises to GitHub (I might even upload this blog). That combined with this blog will be a great time capsule in the future. Nice! I will try and keep you guys updated.</p>
