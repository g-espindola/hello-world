        <p class="text">Welcome to my blog! This is my first entry of, hopefully, many. In here I will try to share with everyone what I’m learning and how I’m progressing on my way to become a full stack web developer using online resources and also as I progress in college to become a computer scientist. This world still looks very intimidating to me at times. There’s just so much to learn and do. A little about my coding background: I have some experience with JavaScript that I got from an online course. Currently, I’m learning more about HTML and CSS on FreeCodeCamp, but nothing too fancy yet, and I also understand a little bit of Java that I got from my computer science course. My progress today was that I did a few CSS exercises on FreeCodeCamp and also finished uploading my learning exercises to GitHub to get familiarized with the work flow. I think I’ll be uploading all of my projects and exercises to GitHub (I might even upload this blog). That combined with this blog will be a great time capsule in the future. Nice! I will try and keep you guys updated.</p>
